<h2> Recycle It! </h2>
Recycle It is an app that promotes recycling by getting users to take a picture of their recyclable goods. Submitting valid photos and verifying another user's submissions reward users with points. These points are used for the leaderboard where you can compete with other users or friends. Additionally, there is a Green Group, where you and your friends can join together and gain more points for yourself and the Group.
